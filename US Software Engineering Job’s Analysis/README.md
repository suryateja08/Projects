This project focuses on predicting salary ranges for software engineering roles in the US using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging features such as job type, location, company, and ratings, the project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing compensation in the software engineering domain. A comparative analysis of K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms was performed, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracyâ€”improving classification performance by 15% over other models. Extensive data analysis, feature engineering, and cross-validation ensured robust and reliable predictions, making this project a comprehensive study in salary classification and machine learning model evaluation.
