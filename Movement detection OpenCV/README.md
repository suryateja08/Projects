This repository showcases two comprehensive projects utilizing OpenCV for real-time video analysis and feature detection. The first project focuses on motion detection, leveraging frame differencing and contour identification to highlight areas of movement in video streams. The second project employs Haar cascades to detect faces, eyes, and smiles in live webcam feeds, demonstrating advanced feature detection capabilities. These projects combine fundamental image processing techniques with practical real-time applications, providing a robust foundation for further exploration in computer vision and machine learning.
