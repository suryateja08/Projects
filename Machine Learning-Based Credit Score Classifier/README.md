This project leverages machine learning to classify customer credit scores into categories—Good, Standard, and Poor—based on financial data such as income, loan records, credit utilization, and payment history. By comparing multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, the ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 88%. The solution is deployed as a Flask web application, providing a real-time interface for users to input financial details and receive instant credit score predictions. This tool demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automating and enhancing credit risk assessments, offering valuable insights for financial institutions.
