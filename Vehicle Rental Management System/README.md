This project is a fully responsive web application for vehicle rental services, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It provides a seamless user experience with features like vehicle search, booking management, and availability filtering. The application integrates Stripe Payment Gateway for secure payment processing and leverages Redux for efficient state management, ensuring scalability and performance. With role-based dashboards for admins and users, robust authentication via JWT, and dynamic functionalities like car addition, editing, and deletion, this system is a comprehensive solution for managing car rentals efficiently.
